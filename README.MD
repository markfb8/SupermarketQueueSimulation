# SupermarketQueueSimulation 
This is a python Event Scheduling simulation implementation of a supermarket which contains 4 queues and 3 types of clients: 
- No doubts (less use time) 
- Some doubts (medium use time) 
- Lots of doubts (long use time) 
  
If any of these wait for more than 15min. they leave.
